### Description
SeeSort is a Java SwingX Application which allows users to visualize three different sorting algorithms  using a step-by-step interactive process. 
The program randomly generates 10 boxes, and allows users to sort the boxes using either **insertion sort**, **selection sort**, or **bubble sort**. By clicking, the users are able to visualize the steps for the algorithm, enabling them to understand how each sort works. At the end of each sort, a new set of boxes are generated and users are able to once again choose another algorithm or exit the program. This project had a focus on Object Oriented Programming to ensure an efficient and understandable program structure.

### Credits
